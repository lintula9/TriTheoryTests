In main .stan file:
- Removed B,
- adjusted priors: std_normal() or, if justified, tight normal prior.
- reverted back to original for loop likelihood computation

Warning messages:
1: There were 500 transitions after warmup that exceeded the maximum treedepth. Increase max_treedepth above 10. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#maximum-treedepth-exceeded 
2: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
3: The largest R-hat is NA, indicating chains have not mixed.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#r-hat 
4: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bulk-ess 
5: Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#tail-ess

in main .stan file:
- Removed the subject intercept from the 0:th unobserved X*
- Larger adapt delta (0.99)
- Some more std_normal() sampling statements. Fixed (at least) now.

Interpretation:
- At least no divergents. Even only with 1000 transitions.

Running cmdstanr, with 1 chain:
- mostly changes to data and parameter declarations in alpha.Rstan
- We'll see if cmdstanr is faster
